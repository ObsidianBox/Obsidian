We always have a need for developers to help us improve Obsidian. There is no such thing as a perfect project and things can always be improved. If you are a developer and are interested in helping then please do not hesitate. Just make sure you follow some guidelines.

### Guidelines
* Formatting pull requests will not be merged!
* Be concise and to the point with your pull request title.
* Be detailed about what you added/changed/removed and why you did so.
* Run `gradle licenseFormat` to add/update license headers. PRs with headerless files will not be accepted.
* The code must be your work or you must accredit those whom you have used code from appropriately.
* Squash/rebase your commits, ten commits to add one thing isn't the prettiest nor easiest to look through in the Git history.
* If you are submitting pull requests to both Magma and Obsidian, reference each other in both of them.

### Code Requirements
* Follow [Oracle's](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconvtoc-136057.html) programming standards.
* Use spaces, not tabs!
* New line at the end of every file.
